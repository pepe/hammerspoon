# My hammerspoon configuration #

First of all, go and install [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org). Really,
you will be pleased with what it can do for you.

## What's inside ##

Mostly simple app runners shortcuts, with couple of gems:

- NoSlacking: quits Slack and reruns it after 30 minutes. Thing about it as Slackodoro.
- Search highlited in new Safari tab, or add it to OmniFocus
- Tea timer with notification
- Get to first pinned page in Safari (Mixcloud for me)
  - Pause/Unpause Mixcloud and get back to the last app

## Installation ##

To install it, just clone this repo somewhere and then link `init.lua` to
`~/.hammerspoon`

## TODO: ##

- PasteBoard automatization
- Slackodoro 2000
